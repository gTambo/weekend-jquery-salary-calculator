# Salary Calculator

## Description
_Duration: 48 hours_

I built a table to receive information from an employee and store it in a table. The information was then used to calculate total monthly costs for the employer. I had to create input fields to recieve the data, and buttons to capture the data, and, once captured, delete the data if desired. Captured data is calculated and posted under the table as the total.
